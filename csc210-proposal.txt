Project Milestone 1

What is the proposed name for your Web application? (Make your GitHub repository name similar to your project name.)
- FlightSee / VisAir / VisiFare

Who is the target audience for your Web application?
- Anyone who is price conscious when purchasing an airline ticket 

How will it meet the minimum project requirements?

* allow users to create accounts and add new persistent data - users will be able to create an account where they can view and favorite multiple flights, as well as save their flight preferences 
* read data from the server and present it on a webpage - the server will both interact with the user database as well as a flights api
* allow users to update their existing data - users can log in and change any of their flights/preferences 
* allow users to delete their own data and accounts - at any moment users can delete any data they have on the database as well as their account
* do all of the above without reloading the webpage (Ajax/Websockets) - the website will utilize Ajax so the webpage does not have to be reloaded (specifically for loading flight information)

Why is your proposed Web application unique or creative beyond simply meeting the minimum requirements?
- it would be extremely beneficial for airline consumers to have a tool to easily and intuitively visualize flight data and save their personal preferences

General Idea
There is a lot of data to be displayed when it comes to searching for the right flight - different prices depending on the day, time of day, and flight options (i.e. non-stop, first class, etc.). Our website will assist users by displaying flight data in a more digestible, intuitive way, as well as store users preferences/search and flight history
